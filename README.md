# ShapesAreaCalculator-ProjectPt1
This is Part 1 of the final project for CSII, my partner is Priscilla Nyadet 

This application will allow you to interactively calculate the area of a circle, rectangle, square, triangle, and calculate a number raised to a power by simply entering
an integer and/or float, and clicking compute! It will not accept negative and string input.
